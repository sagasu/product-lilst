# Product list
This is a simple application displaying an ordered list of products. Applications is aggregating a product price. Application allows filtering products by name case insensitive.

# Further improvements
These are next steps to improve code quality:
1) More tests, adding tests for extracted components and services
2) Introducing SASS and BEM naming conventions
3) Error handling
4) Layout/UI/UX improvements, currently application only uses a small subset of a screen, also there is some flickering issue. I generally recommend introducing some 3rd party styling library.
